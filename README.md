Grapefruit
==========

Grapefruit is a Meteor app that runs on web and mobile. It's an online community for (just about anything) entrepreneurs. I stopped development on it, but I may pick it back up.

People sign in using LinkedIn, and their profile is populated with their skills and interests.

There are three aspects - Events, Projects, and Discussions.

Discussions is a forum where people can ask question and tag them keywords - therefore people viewing discussions can find tags relevant to them.

Events is self explanatory, except you can see who is attending an event and search through the skills/interests of those people before hand.

Projects is essentially a show and tell of what people are working on.
